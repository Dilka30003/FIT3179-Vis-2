        <h1>Earthquakes in Australia</h1>
        <p>
            Earthquakes in Australia occur due to the release of built up stresses within the tectonic plate. As there
            is no major fault lines within Australia, earthquakes on average tend to be weaker and occur at shallower depths.

                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    As Australia is in the middle of a tectonic plate, earthquakes occur relatively infrequently.
                    Compared to a country like New Zealand which is located directly between two tectonic plates,
                    Australia recieves an order of magnitude fewer earthquakes despite being almost 29 times larger

                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    At shallower depths, the magnitude of earthquakes has greater variability. As the depth increases,
                    the variability in magnidue decreases and trends towards the median value. This trend is much more
                    visible in the New Zealand data due to the greater number of earthquakes.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    New Zealand being on a boundary between two tectonic plates also experiences much deeper earthquakes at roughly 10x the depth
